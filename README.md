# Admin-Dashboard

Admin dashboard project for The Odin Project

Project goal was to continue to learn grid to setup the layout of elements.

I learned quite a bit on how to setup the tracks and grid areas for the project.

Learned more about using transparent borders so hover effects that change border do not make the element move.

Utilized a bunch of svg icons from https://materialdesignicons.com/ and learned how to edit the svg files to change the color as needed.

Learned more on styling input fields for the search bar and how to indent the cursor in so a rounded border does not cut it off.

Learned a technique for plain css to manage elipsis cut off for text by numberof lines.

Currently this is really just for flexing my layout muscles, not yet responsive for mobile nor do links actually work.

Overall this project was pretty fun and makes me want to build something real and functional lol!

Can't wait to learn react and node to actually sit down and build some interactive and dynamic projects with the tools I have been collecting!
